Run setup.py before starting. It installs necessary libraries.

You may delete setup.py and requirements.txt after that but its preferable that you keep it since it will be required for every new computer you want to run this on

The software has an encryption algorithm which accepts a number between 1 and 70 and behaves differently depending upon the number given, and 10 different scramblers.

Choose 2 numbers, one between 1 and 70 for encryption algorithm and another between 1 and 10 for scrambler. Remember these 2 numbers since they configure which algorithms are used for encryption and decryption.

Encrypt your passwords with your chosen numbers, which will be stored in passwords-encrypted.json. Even if anyone gets their hand on the file, they will have to try 700 different combinations.

passwords-encrypted.json has a random value at start. This is there because the program misbehaves if it finds an empty json file. Hence, do not leave the file empty, keep the random value

passwords-encrypted.json stores your passwords, encrypted. Keep a copy of this file because any tampering with it will make your passwords irrecoverable. Keeping a copy also saves you from an accidental or mischeiveous tampering

jQuery has been added locally instead of remotely because that will make the software work even without an internet connection
